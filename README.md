**Purpose:** 

This code was created for Mr.Chan's P5 ICS3U Intro to CS Class as an assignment.

**How to Play:**

The user can press the space bar to start the game, the left <-- and right arrow --> key helps move the elephant left and right. The objective is to eat all apples that are falling from the sky. When the elephant eats an apple, the score would increase on the top left corner and the elephant would make a sound. If the elephat fails to eat an apple and the apple reaches the bottom of the world, the game over sign will appear, indicating that the game is over.
